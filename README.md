# Formula Student Corsa Node Board
This is a pcb design for a car we made called Corsa. Corsa is made to create experiences for team to make better cars for formula student races. In this pcb design it is aimed to control the car and getting datas from the car. 

The board designed to use: 
- 3 temprature sensor
- 2 servo motor
- 1 dc motor
- 1 gps sensor
- 1 acceleration sensor
- 1 stop light
- 1 can bus line

That list can be used as a default by just programming. But it is designed to be able to use all of the potential of STM32 blue pill. Sensors and other things can be added as wanted.
